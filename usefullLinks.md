Q3. Write a Program to Print the ASCII Value of a Character.

In C++, each character has some ASCII value associated with it. In this problem, we have to print the ASCII value of the character in the console.

For Example,

    Input: Character = A
    Output: ASCII Value of 'A' = 65

Q8. Write a Program to Find the Largest Among 3 Numbers.

In this problem, you are given 3 numbers, and you have to find out which one is the largest.

For Example,

    Input: a = 10, b = 21 and c = 4
    Output: b is the largest.

Q11. Write a Program to Check Whether a Number Is a Palindrome or Not.

A palindrome number is a number that is equal to itself even after reversing its digits. In this program, we have to check for palindrome numbers.

For Example,

    Input: Number to Check = 1231
    Output: 1231 is not a palindrome number.

Q12. Write a Program to Make a Simple Calculator.

In this problem, you have to make a program that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two numbers entered by the user. The type of arithmetic operation can also be selected by the user.

For Example,

    Input: 
    Enter the Number: 10    25 
    Enter a for addition, 
    s for substraction, 
    m for multiplication, 
    d for division.

    {{if m is entered}}

    Output:  250

Q16. Write a Program to Check if Two Arrays Are Equal or Not.

An array is said to be equal if the elements at the given index are equal in both arrays. In this program, you have to take two arrays, and then check whether the two arrays are equal.

For Example,

    Input:
    arr1[] = {5, 8, 3} 
    arr2[] = {5, 8, 11, 2}

    Output: arr1[] and arr2[] are not equal.

Q19. Write a Program to Search an Element in an Array (Linear Search).

In this program, you have to search for the given element in an array. If the element is found, you will print the index of the element. The array is unsorted.

For Example,

    Input:
    arr[] = {10, 11, 7, 8, 2, 9};
    Element to be Searched: 19

    Output: 19 not found in the arr[]

Q20. Write a Program to Print the Array After It Is Right Rotated K Times.

Array Rotation means shifting the elements n positions to left or right. In this problem, you will have to rotate the array in the right direction k number of times.

For Example,

    Input:
    arr[] = {10, 11, 7, 33, 5, 1};
    K = 3

    Output: Array after rotation: {33, 5, 1, 10, 11, 7}

Q27. Write a Program to Convert String to int.

Like the above problem, you have to create a program to convert the number in the string form to the integer form. But in this program, instead of binary, you have to work with a decimal number system.

For Example,

    Input: str = "69420"
    Output: Number = 69420

Q28. Write a Program to Split a String into a Number of Sub-Strings.

In this problem, you will write a program to split the given string into substrings based on some delimiter. It is also called tokenization.

For Example,

    Input: str = "Welcome Geeks to the GeeksforGeeks portal."

    Output: 
    Welcome
    Geeks
    to
    the
    GeeksforGeeks
    portal.

Q29. Write a Program to Print a Simple Full Pyramid Pattern.

In this problem, you have to print the simple pyramid pattern shown below:

    Input: 5

    Output:

        *
       * *
      * * *
     * * * *
    * * * * * 

Q39. Write a Program to Add Two Complex Numbers.

In this problem, you have to create a complex number of data type and create a method to add the two complex numbers.

For Example,

    Input:
    num1 = 2 + 3i
    num2 = 5 + 11i

    Output: 7 + 14i
